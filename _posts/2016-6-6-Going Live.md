title:  "Going Live"
---

After an interesting experience using multiple languages and tools I never used before, behold, my github blog.  Archive posts detail how I made this site so people can feel free to duplicate it.  

For those who do not know me, I am Christopher Oswald, a graduate student at UNC: Chapel Hill studying educational psychology, measurement and evaluation.  My focus is on self-regulated learning within the context of digital learning environments.  

I am a hobbiest coder who can read and edit scripts easily but has some trouble creating scripts from scratch. I study machine learning and statistics and have a fair deal of skill in that area.  Over the years I have gained some deep knowledge in many content areas, with my focuses being research methodology, media effects, how people interact with technology, how people think, and the history of psychology.

I created this blog to work on my writing, which needs improvement.  In particular, my editing skills.  I do not recall ever being properly taught grammar in English, but I did study it fairly deeply in Latin, so I transfer what I can over.  I am now actively studying writing.  Early entries in this blog may not be the best written, have errors I missed, or other oddities.  I will try to fix them as I see them but this is a learning blog, so some will go live.

I plan to use this blog to talk about things that interest me and offload ideas I have.  My interests are in data science, data analysis, data visualization, research methods, metascience and cognitive and social psychology, and digital education.  Things I wish to offload are programs I find useful, methods of research that I wished I knew about before I stated graduate school and general life hacks I discovered over the years.

I hope to do a post a week to start, but may start slower than that as I am editing my thesis to send it out for a formal copyedit.  

Anyway, I hope people enjoy this, and learn something useful from it.

Until next time, 

Chris
