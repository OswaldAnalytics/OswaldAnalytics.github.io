To summarize the last posts, I started with an empty Github, copied a blog theme, changed the default information to my own and set up the page to support blog posts.  This post will thus deal with creating and posting blogs.

I chose Github and Jekyll for my blogs because they used Markdown.  Markdown is a simplified typesetting language.  Whereas programs like word require you to find the setting you need in one of the many ribbon bars, Markdown you can just type the code yourself.  Since I have not memorized the coding yet, as simple as it may be, and I wanted a live previewer of what I was writing I downloaded Haroopad:

http://pad.haroopress.com/

This gives me a nice two column work enviroment, one where I type in my blog and format with Markdown and the second showing what it will look like when I publish it.

You can write the blogs straight in Github's editor, but Haroopad gives me a nice insert option incase I forget the code to add formatting.

Now this blog does require a certain naming convention.  You must name your files like this:

year-month-day-Title-Of-Blog.md

So year, dash, month, dash, day, dash, title of the blog with dashes between the words, and .md to make sure it saves in the Markdown format.

Now there are several ways to take your finished posts and move them to the blog.  I take the easist option and just upload them into the _posts folder. Simply go to the folder and drag the files into it.  When you upload your first post, delete the temp.md file we made before.

Next post will finish up this series on blog making with some other things you can do.
