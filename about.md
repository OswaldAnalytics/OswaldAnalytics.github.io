I can also be contacted by email at oswaldcsu@gmail.com

This blog is mainly a way for me to share information that I normally would email around and to work on my writing, which currently is a weakness of mine.  I need to learn far better editing skills, so I figured why not make a blog and learn that way.  The blog will be heavily focused on research, software, statistics and data science.

I see posts falling in the following major areas:

1.  Overviews of useful programs.
2.  Things I wish I knew when I started graduate school.
3.  Scripts in different languages to make life easier.
4.  Discussions of articles I find interesting.
5.  Examples of analyses done in different languages.
